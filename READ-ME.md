#JOOλ 
### A Library for missing part of java :)

Java - 8 provides basic Functional Interfaces that accept up to 2 parameters. Hence, to implement something having more parameters, you will need to create a dedicated package with such special case functional Interfaces.
But `Consumer and Function` FI with more than 1-2 parameters  are going to be a common scenario for almost all the projects. Then, why not to have a library for same.

`JOOλ` provides support for Consumer and Functions from 0 parameter to 16 parameters.

An equivalent package `org.jooq.lambda.function` for consumers and functions has been created. You can find all the FI with suffix 0 <=n <=16 e.g.
 Consumer0, Function16 etc.
